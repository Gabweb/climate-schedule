## Schedule management
- As a user, I want to create a daily schedule with time blocks and target temperatures so that my rooms follow a routine.
- As a user, I want to set overrides (e.g., a one-time change for today) without editing the full schedule.
- As a user, I want to pause or disable a schedule temporarily.
- As a user, I want adjacent time blocks to auto-adjust so the schedule always covers 00:00–23:59 without gaps.
- As a user, I want to add or remove time blocks (up to 10) so I can match my routine.

## Execution and visibility
- As a user, I want to see when a schedule last ran and what temperature it applied so that I can verify behavior.
- As a user, I want a manual “run now” action to test a schedule.
- As a user, I want to see errors if a climate entity is unavailable.

## Modes
- As a user, I want to define modes per room (e.g., Holiday, Weekend, Workday) so each room can have its own set.
- As a user, I want to switch a room to one of its modes so its schedule changes accordingly.

## Defaults
- As a user, I want a default mode with a default schedule created for each room so I can get started quickly.

## Admin and troubleshooting
- As an admin, I want logs and diagnostics to troubleshoot schedule execution.
- As an admin, I want backups/exports of schedules to move them between systems.
